# How basic is your music taste?

How basic is your music taste is a website that connects with the spotify API to determine how plain someones listening experience is. Someone who listens only to popular artists like Drake, Taylor Swift, Bad Bunny,may be described as basic. If you listen only to deep cuts, music that is less popular or from obscure artitst you are less basic.

### Elevator pitch


Do you listen to the same music as everyone else? With "How basic is your music?" you can connect your spotify account and find out how unique you are. You will get a score that tells you if you are a part of the underground scene enjoying deep cuts and obscure songs, or if your only enjoying mainstream sounds. You will get a pulse on your listening profile and be able to share it with your friends. What type of listener are you? Who in your friend group has the most basic music taste?

## ðŸš€ CSS deliverable

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] **Header, footer, and main content body** - Header includes a title and image for each page. The header also contains the nav bar
- [x] **Navigation elements** - I made a simple navigation bar that navigates to my 4 html pages. Login, analyze, leaderboard, about.
- [x] **Responsive to window resizing** - The bootsrap framework makes this easy. i ncluded the javascript responsiveness bundle at the end of each body tag on all pages. My meta tag makes sure mobile renders at 1:1. I used the boostrap grid system. My imgage uses img-fluid which makes it scale. The large text at the top gets smaller to fit a small window. All elements stay centered with resizing.
Bootstrap uses flexboxes heavily.
