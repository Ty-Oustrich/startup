# How basic is your music taste?

How basic is your music taste is a website that connects with the spotify API to determine how plain someones listening experience is. Someone who listens only to popular artists like Drake, Taylor Swift, Bad Bunny,may be described as basic. If you listen only to deep cuts, music that is less popular or from obscure artitst you are less basic.



## ðŸš€ Specification Deliverable


For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] Proper use of Markdown

### Elevator pitch


Do you listen to the same music as everyone else? With "How basic is your music?" you can connect your spotify account and find out how unique you are. You will get a score that tells you if you are a part of the underground scene enjoying deep cuts and obscure songs, or if your only enjoying mainstream sounds. You will get a pulse on your listening profile and be able to share it with your friends. What type of listener are you? Who in your friend group has the most basic music taste?

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **Web service** - Backend service for:
- login
- Spotify api integration
- process score with algorithm
- **DB/Login** - stores each score with the corresponding username to perpetuate accurate percentile calculation for each new user. Stores username only with succesful login.
- **WebSocket** - Users will see live updates on the loading bar as their score is being calculated ex. "connecting with spotify", "sorting data", "crunching the numbers" etc.
